# Crowd Funding Application Built on Rootstock Blockchain

This dapp is used by users to source for funding for their next big idea. The dapp interacts with a smart contract deployed to the Rootstock blockcahin and a sub-graph that displays logs from the smart contract. The application makes use of two smart contract, a factory smart contract and an implementation smart contract. Each crowd funding campaign is a seperate contract deployed to the Rootstock blockcahian. 

Users can donate to any worthy project using Rootstock native token `(TRBTC)`. A donor can withdraw their donation at any point they wish. A campaign owner creates milestones which are voted on by donors before they can withdraw the donated tokens. The donation can only be withdrawan when the duration to raise funds set by the campaign owner has elapsed and donation can be withdrawan three times.
